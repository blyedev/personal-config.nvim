# blyedev.nvim

## Introduction

This is my personal configuration as BlyeDev.

## Installation

Don't. There are dependencies unlisted that exist solely because I didn't know any better at the time of implementing. This exists purely as an archive for me to take inspiration. The new repo either already is or will be `blyedev/nvim-config` and will be rewritten from scratch -ish.
